# [LeetCode] 389. Find the Difference

## Problem

> You are given two strings `s` and `t`.
> String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.
> Return the letter that was added to `t`.
> [[LeetCode] 389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/?envType=study-plan&id=programming-skills-i)

## Solution

- As `s` and `t` can include duplicate characters, so I used algorithm finding intersection of two sorted arrays.
- Sort two strings first, compare all characters in two strings.
- Time Complexity: **O(n\*logn)**, Space Complexity: **O(n)**

```typescript
function findTheDifference(s: string, t: string): string {
  const sChars = s.split("").sort();
  const tChars = t.split("").sort();
  for (let i = 0; i < sChars.length; i++)
    if (sChars[i] !== tChars[i]) return tChars[i];
  return tChars[tChars.length - 1];
}
```

## Other's Solution

- Think string as a array of characters which can be represented as number(ASCII) as well.
- Sum of all characters in `t` subtracted by sum of all characters in `s` will be the difference between `s` and `t`.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**, Space Complexity: **O(1)**

```typescript
function findTheDifference(s: string, t: string): string {
  const sSum = toCharacterSum(s);
  const tSum = toCharacterSum(t);
  return String.fromCharCode(tSum - sSum);
}

function toCharacterSum(s: string): number {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) sum += s.charCodeAt(i);
  return sum;
}
```
